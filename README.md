# VeriLibraryFYP
An interactive library application that saves and shows a Verilog algorithm or modules' resource utilisation when run at different parameters. Coded in Java.

An embedded system developer can use the application to select the most optimal module for their design. The application can help to export the module as is or instantiate multiple modules together for use in another top-module. It generates a top-module file as well.

# Features
1. Feature-rich - Add, edit, modify, and view the performance parameters of any module in an intuitive UI.
2. Ease of use - Instantiate modules and export the top-module file consisting of those modules.
3. Safety - Error checking to prevent invalid inputs and improve the user experience.
4. Flexibilty - Edit the names and width of wire declarations to suit your needs.
